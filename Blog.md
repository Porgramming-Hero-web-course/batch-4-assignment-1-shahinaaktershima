# The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.
In TypeScript, union and intersection types are powerful tools for defining the shape and constraints of data in ways that help ensure type safety and enhance code readability.

## Union Type
A union type represents a value that can be one of several possible types. This is helpful when a variable can take on multiple forms, enabling us to define more flexible structures while still enforcing constraints.
- A union type in TypeScript allows a variable to have one of several types. It is represented using the | operator.
- Example: type Animal = "Dog" | "Cat" | "Bird";
- In this example, a variable of type Animal can have the value "Dog", "Cat", or "Bird".
## Intersection Type
An intersection type combines multiple types into one, meaning the resulting type must satisfy all constituent types. This is useful when we need a type that possesses the properties of several types.
- An intersection type combines multiple types into a single type, representing the combination of all types. It is represented using the & operator.
- Example: type Person = { name: string } & { age: number };
- In this example, a variable of type Person must have both a name property of type string and an age property of type number.

 <p> Both concepts are essential for creating robust, type-safe applications in TypeScript, especially in complex systems where strict typing is crucial for reducing runtime errors and improving code reliability.</p>
